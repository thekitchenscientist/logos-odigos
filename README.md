Investigating ways to explore a text based on vector similarity, graph nodes, geospatial and relational data.

The Bible is an interesting collection of 66 books grounded in history and geography. It covers a variety of literary styles and has been adapted to a wide range of mediums, audiences and languages.

There are databases of all the people and places mentioned in the text (along with estimated geospatial coordinates), databases of the ~300k cross references between the books and mutiple public domain translations. This provides an interesting case study for applying techniques such as graph databases, vector databases, retreval augmented generation with large language models, personas for Solo Preformance Prompting (SPP) and more.
